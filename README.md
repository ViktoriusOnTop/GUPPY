AI systems that detect medical diseases

# DISCLAMER

#### This AI system is not intended to treat or diagnose any medical disorder. DO NOT take the output as fact, but instead, treat it as a lie, for your own safety. If you have suspicions of a medical disorder, consult a proper medical expert.

### Installation instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViktoriusOnTop/GUPPY.git
```
then run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Warning:
#### The notebook assumes you are using a Windows PC with CUDA installed. Otherwise, the notebook may be slow.

Make sure you're in a jupyter-capable IDE (like PyCharm).
If you are in vscode, install the python and jupyter extensions.

Now, you're ready to run submission.ibynb
